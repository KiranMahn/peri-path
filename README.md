### What do the dots in the Calendar mean
After following the steps for [how to track symptoms](#i-have-symptoms-i-want-to-document-today), you can see in the calendar box for the 31st of March that there are now red dots. 

<img src="./assets/images/daybox.png" alt="Day Box" width="100"/>

- The letter at the top left represents the day of the week (e.g. M for Monday).
- The red circle at the top right hand corner of the box represents any period data that has been tracked. The heavier the period the darker the color of the circle. 
- The smaller circles along the bottom of the day box represent the symptoms tracked and their severity. 
   - Yellow circle = Low severity
   - Bright red circle = Medium Severity 
   - Dark red circle = High severity 
   - Bright red with a plus = 5 or more than symptoms have been tracked

Details for that day can be found by clicking on the Calendar button in the navigation bar at the bottom and then clicking on the day you want to see details for. If you press the edit button you will be taken to the Track screen for that day.
